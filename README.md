# Brain-Tumer-Detection
--> Develop a highly accurate automated system for detecting brain tumors from MRI images 
using state-of-the-art deep learning models and explainable AI techniques.

--> Implemented and trained various deep learning models including ResNet50, VGG19, ResNet101, and a custom
 simple neural network model to compare performance on the brain tumor MRI dataset from kaggle.

--> Integrated explainable AI techniques, including Layer-by-Layer Visualization and SHAP values, to provide
 insights into which features were most influential in model predictions, thereby increasing the interpretability
 and trustworthiness of the results.
